		<h2>THE GREAT DEPRESSION (1929)</h2>
		<p style= "font-style: italic; margin-left: 8px; "> This was the biggest recession in US history which lasted for almost 10 years i.e.from 1929 - 1938. The depression took place because of the Stock Market Crash. During the 1920s, the stock market in the US underwent rapid expansion. In order to get profit from high stock prices, Investors rushed to brokers to invest their money.They sold out their bonds and mortgaged their properties to invest in the Stock Market. But, due to the crash in the Stock Market in 1929, people rushed back to sell their stocks which made this market crash even worse. This depression was exacerbated by the increased interest rate on loans by the Federal Bank and a drought in 1930 popularly known as “The Dust Bowl '' .During this period, the Unemployment Rate reached over 20%.
       			   Thereafter, ‘The New Deal’ was enacted by President Franklin Roosevelt during 1933 to 1939 to get back from this destructive Recession.
