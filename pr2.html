	  BLOG: History of Recessions in United States </h1>
		
		<p style= "font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px; "> In the United States of America, economic recessions at some interval of time is quite common. But this country always bears with the recession, and comes up with a new United States of America every time.To understand the cause and effect of Recession, it is important to get a deep dive into the history of US Recessions.
		<br><br> Let us first discuss the meaning of Recession. A Recession is a significant decline in economic activities for particular amount of time, usually for more than 5 to 6 months. 
		Among various factors which are used to determine Recession, two of the major ones are GDP Growth Rate and Unemployment Rate.<br>
		Recession leads to lower GDP growth rate. <b>So, if the GDP growth rate of a country is negative for consecutive two quarters, it is considered to be Recession.</b> Along with this, it affects the career growth as well as business survival and growth which increases the Unemployment Rate.

		<p style= "text-align: center;"><img src="pr2_fig1.jpg" alt="Fig.1"><br>Fig.1 </p>
		<p style= "font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px; "> Fig. 1 shows the variation in Unemployment Rate of the USA from 1940 to 2020. In the plot, the Unemployment Rate is increasing continuously and reaching its peak and then, after that, it is declining.The part where the Rate is increasing is due to various Recessions happened in the history of the USA.
			Let’s discuss some of the Recessions which had a huge impact on the US economy.
		</p><br><br>
		<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 10px;">The Great Depression(1929)</h2>
		<p style= "font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px; "> This was the biggest recession in US history which lasted for almost 10 years i.e.from 1929 - 1938. The depression took place because of the Stock Market Crash. During the 1920s, the stock market in the US underwent rapid expansion. In order to get profit from high stock prices, Investors rushed to brokers to invest their money.They sold out their bonds and mortgaged their properties to invest in the Stock Market. But, due to the crash in the Stock Market in 1929, people rushed back to sell their stocks which made this market crash even worse. This depression was exacerbated by the increased interest rate on loans by the Federal Bank and a drought in 1930 popularly known as “The Dust Bowl '' .During this period, the Unemployment Rate reached over 20%.
       			   Thereafter, ‘The New Deal’ was enacted by President Franklin Roosevelt during 1933 to 1939 to get back from this destructive Recession.
 		</p><br><br>
		<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 10px;">The Post War Recession</h2>
		<p style= "font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px;"> This Recession began in November 1948 and continued till October 1949. After World War II, in 1945, many civilians returned from the war and entered the workforce again. This increased the Unemployment Rate significantly. Unemployment Rate reached 7.9 %, the highest for this time period, in October 1949.
				During this time, the USA Government was concerned regarding another Recession, but inflation proved to be a much greater concern at that time. Fig. 2 shows the variation in Unemployment Rate and GDP Growth Rate in this recession period. We can clearly see how the unemployment rate is continuously increasing with a declining economic growth (a negative GDP).

		<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 10px;">The Post Korean War Recession</h2>
		<p style= "font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px;"> This recession resulted from demobilization after the end of Korean-War. The act of the Federal Reserve of tightening monetary policy to curb inflation in 1952 and the drastic change in interest rates are mainly responsible for decreased GDP Growth Rate. It lasted for 10 months and led the Unemployment Rate to its peak i.e. 6.1% in October 1954.
			Fig. 3 shows that the GDP Growth Rate was negative for three quarters in 1954. The Unemployment Rate although decreased after that, but was significantly high even post-recession.

		<p style= "text-align: center;"><img src="pr2_fig3.jpg" alt="Fig.3"><br>Fig.3 </p>
		<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 10px;">The Eisenhower Recession</h2>
		<p style= "font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px;"> Contractionary Monetary Policy was the main reason behind this Recession. The Bank restricted the liquidity of money and also raised interest rates to make lending expensive so that money supply by banks can be lowered down.  This was done in order to ward off inflation.
			The GDP went down drastically in 1958 first quarter and the Unemployment Rate reached  7.4% in April 1958. We can see the same condition in fig. 4.
		</p>						   
		<p style= "text-align: center;"><img src="pr2_fig4.jpg" alt="Fig.4"><br>Fig.4 </p>
		<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-left: 10px;">The Oil Crisis Recession</h2>
		<p style= "font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px;"> The main reason behind this Recession was high prices of oil. These high prices of oil were the result of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) Oil Embargo in 1973, a decision to stop exporting oil to the United States. This led to fuel shortages and sky-high prices throughout much of the decade.
			This alone was not responsible for the Recession of 1973. Another reason was President Nixon’s policy which included imposition of harmful wage-price controls to control mild inflation. This kept prices too high, reducing demand and forced businesses to lay off workers. Even worse, Nixon ended the Gold Standard which tied the dollar's value to gold. These all factors together created a huge impact on the economy of the US at that time. GDP growth continued to be negative for four consecutive quarters.  Unemployment Rate continued to increase even after Recession and reached 9% in May 1975 (two months after recession ended).
